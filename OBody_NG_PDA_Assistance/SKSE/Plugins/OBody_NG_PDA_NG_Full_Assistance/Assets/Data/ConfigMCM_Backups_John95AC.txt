This folder you found is for automatically saving and managing the configurations of all advanced MCMs. 
The system generates automatic backups by itself, just like OSTIM and other mods, 
so that when you update any MCM it can read the settings from here without fear of losing them in the updates. 
Ah, and by the way, this was one of the last ideas that occurred to me –during the mod creation process, 
it didn't even cross my mind to make a config backups system. I was saving everything in the same mod folder, 
but if you update, all the favorites and such get reset, ahahaha, 
sometimes I overlook the simplest and most basic things. I hope you enjoy my mods,
and you know, any idea or problem, send me a message on Nexus or other means,
